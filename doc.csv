Plain text files, written in seven different languages, were encoded by seven cryptographic algorithm under ECB mode. The resulting cryptograms were submitted to a transformation so that it was possible to create metadata files. These files provide information for six data mining algorithms in order to identify the cryptographic algorithm used for encryption. The identification performance was evaluated and the language influence at the procedure was analyzed. The overall experiment involves many cryptograms, a great quantity of metadata, a huge time consuming computation, and therefore, it was employed a high performance computer. The successful identification for each mining algorithm is greater than a probabilistic bid, and there are several scenarios where algorithm identification reaches almost full recognition. © 2003-2012 IEEE."

In addition, the new ‘clickbait’ dynamics are aggravating the already fragile positioning of the journalistic phenomenon in the contemporary world. This algorithmic turn, which came to politics, news and social interaction, is evolving to a fathomless dimension, not only because it constituted the algorithm in gatekeeper but also because it created propaganda machines specializing in social engineering, in automating political behavior and in emotional chains, manipulating opinion and creating new spirals of silence. Culture, politics and communication face these new gulfs. In this paper we will try to analyze this vertigo, this technologization and dystopia of mediation and knowledge, the new propaganda, armed now by Artificial Intelligence, in which digital platforms and their algorithms do not yet control the processes of interaction and communication, although they clearly monitor and track us, bringing the democratic experience back to more complex levels of historical and political regression.

The objective of this study was to analyze the difficulties and results from two different processes of document categorization in a restricted knowledge domain. The first one was based on the use of keywords and the second was based on the use of citations for document representation. To illustrate the use of different attributes in document representation, two experiments were conducted. The first one used a categorization algorithm based on keywords. The second experiment generated categories, using Artificial Neural Networks, from the citations of the articles. In the restricted knowledge domain, as used in this study, it was difficult to form groups that use keywords as attributes of the categorization process due to the great similarity of keywords used by the authors. The citations can be, as shown in the second experiment, an alternative and more efficient attribute for the categorization process of these documents. The formation of a set of articles with significant bibliographic coupling and a strong semantic relationship validated the method proposed. The article details the methodology used in the experiments, showing the importance of careful pre-processing phase for the reliability of the databases. This study may contribute to the research related to the representation of documents in categorization processes and information retrieval."

Based on the OSCO (online stochastic combinatorial optimization) problem, it is presented a framework to operate such problem in a last-mile delivery system where customers requests from e-commerce (or food delivery) along an operations day. The deterministic calculation was realized using a permutational flowshop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing makespan. Experiments indicated convergence in the algorithm along the planning trials, and a satisfactory makespan prediction, before the orders are revealed, with accuracy.

We considered 147 ma thematical puzzles, used by Bocconi University for mathematical games among students in the 4th and 5th years of primary school, and we found that they can be viewed, in most cases, as Constraint-Based problems. In order to study the problem-solving process used by school children, some mathematical puzzles with a specific number of variables, domains and constraints, were created ad hoc for the study and were administered to 37 students in the 4th year of primary school. Results showed that problems with the same number of variables as domains were more easily solved than problems with a different number of variables and domains. These results were discussed from the viewpoints of Artificial Intelligence and of Cognitive Psychology in order to provide new insights into the definition of fully-fledged, intelligent agents able to solve mathematical puzzles. © 2020, Societa Editrice il Mulino."

In this combat modality, it is necessary to make decisions based on information from sensors, mainly radars. Furthermore, since information regarding enemy aircraft systems is sometimes unknown, pilots' decisions are usually based on beliefs regarding the opponent. The presented model proposes to deal with such characteristics, generating behaviors for entities represented in a constructive simulation environment, i.e., simulated people operating simulated systems. We created BVR air combat simulations between two aircraft, with only one missile each, through Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to choose input variables to cover almost homogeneously all their ranges. The aircraft have similar behaviors, and their parameters may change only at the beginning of the simulation. The simulation environment generated ten thousand air combat scenarios, varying thirty-six input parameters, for the analysis proposed in the case study. From this data, we could create supervised machine learning models that substantially improve the BVR air combat pilot's situational awareness regarding offensive situations, in which the reference aircraft employs a missile against a target, or defensive positions, in contrast to when the same reference aircraft tries to avoid a possible enemy's missile launched in its direction. The offensive and defensive models were consistent with the accuracy of 0.930 and 0.924 and the F1-score of 0.717 and 0.678, respectively. Thus, the contribution of this work is to use machine learning algorithms to generate responses concerning the tactical state to improve the pilot's situational awareness and, therefore, the in-flight decision-making process.  © 2003-2012 IEEE."

Drilling is an operation that entails high costs that demands efficiency. A classification of the various operations during drilling is vital to generate assumptions of duration for the design of new wells. For this paper, two classification analyses for operation classification were conducted to identify the Non-Productive Time (NPT) and Productive Time (PT) best model. Conclusions led to Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) as the best model. The classification system can produce an accurate and detailed report on the activities performed during the drilling of a well. Through this work, it is possible to conclude that the currently available daily drilling report represents a rich source of information and can optimize the oil well construction process. © 2021, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

"Democracy at risk? Exploring the contribution of digital journalism to the filter bubble phenomenon; [Democracia em risco?

Journalism – a pillar of democratic societies – is usually portrayed as the filter bubble’s antithesis, whose harmful effects on democracy seem to be consensual. However, what has not been sufficiently studied is the contribution of digital journalism to the phenomenon. This exploratory article aims to open new research avenues on the topic, using a qualitative methodology, through a deep literature review and an analysis of secondary data. Based on a theoretical and practical analysis, it is suggested that the new business models of digital journalism – which heavily rely on technology companies, advertisers, and the audience – are largely contributing to the filter bubble. Newsrooms are increasingly collecting and analyzing consumer data to personalize information, both in the digital advertising and subscription models. Moreover, this personalization is perceived enthusiastically by the media, with few voices reflecting on its negative side. We conclude that journalism can assume a relevant role in the fight against information bubbles, both through the review of its digital business models and by raising the individuals’ awareness about the problem. © 2021 Obercom.

Since then, world governments have coordinated information flows and issued guidelines to contain the overwhelming effects of this disease. At the same time, the scientific community is continually seeking information about transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of the disease, new diagnoses, and strategies for prevention and treatment. One of the challenges is performing the tests for the diagnosis of the disease, whose technique adopted for the detection of the genetic material of COVID-19 requires equipment and specialized human resources, making it an expensive procedure. We hypothesize that machine learning techniques can be used to classify the test results for COVID-19 through the joint analysis of popular laboratory tests' clinical parameters. Machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines Regression, enable the creation of disease prediction models and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze clinical parameters. Thus, we evaluated the existing correlations between laboratory parameters and the result of the COVID-19 test, and developed two classification models: the first classifies the test results for patients with suspected COVID-19, and the second classifies the hospitalization units of patients with COVID-19, both according to the laboratory parameters. The models achieved an accuracy above 96%, showing that they are promising to the classification of tests for COVID-19 and screen patients by hospitalization unit. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

This means that a lot of people have to wait for long periods of time without knowing whether the bus is near or far away, and it raises serious problems of traffic mobility that affect millions of public transport users every day. One way out is to seek solutions based on software and artificial intelligence that can help the public when making their everyday journey. However, most of them still need to be approved by private companies or the local government. This article sets out an online monitoring strategy for bus routes on a collaborative basis, i.e., among the users, as an alternative system that does not need to be authorized by private companies of the local government. It involves adopting the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and creating two new algorithms called Activation of the Regressive Timer and Deactivating Collaborative Mode.

The key strengths of ELM are its simple formulation and the reduced number of hyper-parameters. Among these hyper-parameters, the number of hidden nodes has significant impact on ELM performance since too few/many hidden nodes may lead to underfitting/overfitting. In this work, we propose a pruning strategy for ELM using the Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) as an approach to automatically find the number of hidden nodes. SPA was originally proposed for variable selection. In this work, it was adapted in order to be used to prune ELMs. The proposed method was compared to the Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine algorithm (OP-ELM), which is considered as a state of the art method. Real world datasets were used to assess the performance of the proposed method for regression and classification problems. The application of the proposed model resulted in much simpler models with similar performance compared to the OP-ELM.

The K-means algorithm presented good results when applied in the discovery of similar routes, thus becoming an important tool applied to the work of monitoring vehicles routes. © IBERAMIA and the authors."
"Assessment of Noise Impact on Hybrid Adaptive Computational Intelligence Multisensor Data Fusion Applied to Real-Time UAV Autonomous Navigation","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084584319&doi=10.1109%2fTLA.2020.9085283&partnerID=40&md5=aa9c160622ad75cefeb571c75ade9ee3","Recent work have successfully employed a low-cost Multisensor Data Fusion application based on Hybrid Adaptive Computational Intelligence (HACI)-the cascaded use of Fuzzy-based Computational Intelligence algorithms. The methodology has been shown able to improve considerably the accuracy of current positioning estimation systems for real-time Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autonomous navigation-which are not robust-reducing the error in more than 45.19%. However, HACI methodology was found to have a sensitivity to noise in some parts of the estimated trajectories and, therefore, loss of performance. The problem is that none of these recent work assesses the impact of noise present on input signals and the potential benefits of their treatment prior to fusion itself. This is the main contribution of this work. Noise treatment is performed in two approaches: noise removal and noise filtering. It has been shown that for the studied dataset, the noise has a negative impact and that the chosen techniques are capable of adequately handling the noise so as to improve the original GPS precision by almost 57%. © 2003-2012 IEEE."

This paper presents the development of a Deep Learning model, trained from the Skin Cancer MNIST database (HAM10000). It is able to perform Classification of Pigmented Dermatological Lesions using Convolutional Neural Networks techniques by proposing an ensemble with Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks. In order to evaluate the Convolutional Networks, the metrics Accuracy, Precision, Revocation and F1-Score were taken into consideration. The ensemble implementation was based on a Grid Search with Cross Validation and evaluated according to Accuracy. The obtained results show the relevance of the research and the consolidation of the techniques used in the development of Artificial Intelligence solutions applied to clinical images analysis. Accuracy and Recall reached 0.93 and Precision and F1-Score 0.92, which is superior performance to specialists and related researches. © 2003-2012 IEEE."
